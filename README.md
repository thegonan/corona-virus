# Corona Virus Tracker

The charts that I found online were tracking totals, but this does not help to understand the amount of cases based on population or the number of cases vs the previous day.

I created these charts to visualize growth from previous day, compare cases between countries, with an example showing recoveries on a per-capita basis and actual totals.
